#1. AI need to think in Winning position and losing position using modulo calculate. In the formula we need to minus 1 to make AI not the one who get the last stick.
# the losing postion is n â‰¡ 1 mod (k+1) or 1, k+2, 2k + 3 ... .If the AI in losing postion it will take 1 and make player in losing position.
#2. Yes, the AI should win every rounds.
#3. The strategy of the AI won't change.
